Networks
========

Let's play around with networking.

1) Write a TCP server that can understand requests from your browser. Puts out a 'hello world'
message so that you can see the connection working.
2) Add support to your server so that you can serve a random image from the public/images folder
3) Add support to your server so that you can serve any of the images matching a given path.
4) Put on a shoes front-end to display the image.
